5. Chaincode
6. MSP policies
7. CA certificates

Breaking Down Deployment Procedure

1. Checking dependencies are matched
2. Cleanup previous configurations and setup fresh directories
3. Prepare configurations
4. Generate artifacts
5. Upload artifacts and install peers and orderer on nodes
6. Start orderer and peers
7. Create Channel
8. Join peers to channel
9. Install chaincode on peers
10. Instantiate chaincode on boot-peer(s)
11. Invoke chaincode
12. Query chaincode on each peer to test
13. Finish


1. Creating a Channel
    1. Creating a profile for the channel
    2. Creating a sign-able channel definition i.e. .tx file
    3. Creating channel
2. Peer joins Channel
